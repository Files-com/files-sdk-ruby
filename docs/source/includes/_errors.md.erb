The Files.com API returns standard HTTP success (`2xx`) or error (`4xx`, `5xx`) status codes.

Some errors contain additional information in the response body.  We have not been perfectly consistent with the formatting of these errors and will be standardizing them in the future.

### HTTP status codes

Code | Description
---- | -----------
200 - OK | The request was successful.
201 - Created | The resource was successfully created.
204 - No response | The request was successful. The only difference between a 200 and 204 is the lack of response provided by that endpoint.
400 - Bad request | Bad request.
401 - Unauthorized | Your API key or username/password is invalid.
403 - Forbidden | You don't have permission to access this resource.
404 - Not found | The resource does not exist.
422 - Unprocessable entity | The request could not be processed. Usually this is due to validation error of a parameter, but it could also be something like a username already taken, folder already existing, etc.
5xx - Server error | An error occured with our API.  Wait some time and then try again.  If you get a 500 repeatedly, it may be a bug.  Please report it.
